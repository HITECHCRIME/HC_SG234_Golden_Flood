## Lyrics

```
hitech crime
hitech crime ya

i don't wanna know what's high
i don't wanna know what i got inside
make your choice through the voice
that's screaming loud - make it right already
keep your life so steady 
through the curse of golden flood
hundred drowning souls in external life
little bit of toughest arcs
that's allright, that's allright ya

make it through the night
make it through the night
that's what i tell myself when the last light dies 
every day sun will come again, i swear
flood for retinas like morning prayers
to the gods of broken dawn

we feel everything, circling with our doubts,
what happened in the past cannot be undone

we feel everything, circling with our doubts,
what happened in the past can never be undone

count through the pain it will go away
sooner or later does it matter if you stay 
old tempers used to fade with rising rays of warmth
basking in the glory of ancient stories still foretold
past year i've grown so old i've grown so old



stil foretold anew newest context for your soul


```
